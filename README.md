# Project "my_string", a mutable and an immutable string implementation in C++11
> This project is a C++ string implementation, designed to display the author's (SametTasti) skills:

>> Therefore, the mutable string type will be implemented with less features from the C++11 standard (it will be implemented similar to what you would expect to see in a C project, e.g. memory management etc.) since it is practically harder to implement a mutable string (in respect to its immutable counterpart) and the immutable string type will be implemented with features available in C++11 standard (e.g. pointer wrappers, algorithms etc.).
